# InteractiveBiology
The main goal of this project was to prototype a simple biology exhibit to help display the effects of climate change on different species. The goal was to create a simple animal and plant simulator that would allow for users to control the temperature and speed of the simulation to show the effects on the simulation. 

From a more technical standpoint this was a way to test out some basic pathfinding, and agent goals. 

*This is not a finished project and as such is likely a bit buggy and could use some visual enhancement*
